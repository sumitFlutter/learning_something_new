You **technically can** connect a frontend directly to a database, but in real-world/corporate applications, it’s avoided for important reasons:

---

## 🚫 1. Security Risks (Biggest reason)

If frontend (React, Flutter, etc.) connects directly:

* Database credentials (username/password) must be exposed
* Anyone can inspect code and **steal access**

👉 Example:
A hacker could open DevTools and directly run queries like:

```sql
DELETE FROM users;
```

---

## 🔐 2. No Access Control / Business Logic

A backend (server) acts like a **gatekeeper**.

Without backend:

* No proper validation
* No role-based access (admin vs user)
* No rules enforcement

With backend:

* Only allowed actions are executed
* Sensitive logic stays hidden

---

## 📉 3. Data Integrity Issues

Frontend is **untrusted** (user-controlled).

Without backend:

* Users can send wrong or malicious data
* Database can get corrupted

Backend ensures:

* Validation (correct format, required fields)
* Sanitization (prevent SQL injection)

---

## ⚙️ 4. No Centralized Logic

Backend handles:

* Calculations
* Workflows
* Complex operations

If everything is in frontend:

* Code becomes messy
* Logic can be easily bypassed

---

## 🚀 5. Scalability & Performance

Backend can:

* Cache data
* Optimize queries
* Manage load

Frontend → DB direct:

* Too many uncontrolled requests
* Poor performance at scale

---

## 🧠 Proper Architecture

```
Frontend (App / Website)
        ↓
Backend (API / Server)
        ↓
Database
```

---

## 🎯 Real-life Analogy

Think of a **bank** 🏦:

* You (frontend) don’t go directly to the vault (database)
* You talk to a **bank employee (backend)**
* They verify and then access the vault safely

---

## ⚠️ Exception (Controlled cases)

Some services like:

* Firebase
* Supabase

Allow frontend access BUT:

* With strict security rules
* Limited permissions
* Token-based authentication

---

## ✅ Conclusion

We don’t directly connect frontend to database because:

* 🔐 Security
* 🧠 Control
* 📊 Data safety
* 🚀 Scalability
