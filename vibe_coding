**Vibe coding** is an informal slang term in programming that means:

> Coding based on intuition, flow, and creativity — without strict planning, documentation, or heavy structure.

It’s when a developer just “feels the vibe” and starts building.

### 🔥 What vibe coding usually looks like:

* No detailed architecture planning
* Minimal comments
* Rapid trial-and-error
* Testing directly in browser/app
* Refactoring later (or sometimes never 😅)
* Using AI tools like ChatGPT to generate parts quickly

---

### 🎧 Example:

Instead of:

> “First I’ll design the database schema, then API structure, then UI components…”

Vibe coder:

> “Let’s just build the screen first and see what happens.”

---

### ✅ Pros:

* Very fast prototyping
* Creative freedom
* Good for hackathons & MVPs
* Fun and motivating

### ❌ Cons:

* Can become messy quickly
* Hard to scale
* Technical debt increases
* Bugs hide easily

### 🚀 In today’s AI era

Many developers (especially indie devs and startup builders) combine vibe coding + AI tools to build apps extremely fast.

Looking at your projects (Flutter apps, AI style transfer, stock prediction systems), sometimes you’re doing structured coding — but sometimes you’re definitely vibe coding too 😄

If you want, I can also explain:

* Difference between vibe coding vs clean architecture
* When vibe coding is good
* How to vibe code *without* breaking your project

Just tell me 👍
