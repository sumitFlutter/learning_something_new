RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) in property refers to India's Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, designed to bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to the real estate sector, protecting homebuyers' interests by regulating builders, agents, and projects. It mandates project registration, ensures funds are used for construction (via separate accounts), promotes fair practices (like selling by carpet area), and provides a dispute resolution mechanism, making transactions fairer and boosting investor confidence. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Key Aspects of RERA 

• Full Form: Real Estate Regulatory Authority. 
• Purpose: To protect homebuyers and promote fair practices in real estate transactions. 
• Regulatory Body: Establishes state-level authorities (RERA) to oversee projects and ensure compliance. 
• Mandatory Registration: Builders must register projects with the state RERA before marketing or selling. 
• Financial Security: Developers must deposit at least 70% of buyer funds into a separate account for project construction. 
• Transparency: Builders must provide accurate project details, including land ownership and approvals. 
• Area Measurement: Sales are based on carpet area, not super built-up area, preventing hidden charges. 
• Accountability: Imposes strict timelines for project delivery and provides penalties for delays, with compensation for buyers. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]  

Benefits for Buyers 

• Protection from Fraud: Safeguards against builder malpractice and project delays. 
• Timely Delivery: Ensures projects are completed as promised. 
• Fair Pricing: Clarity on carpet area and advance payments (max 10% before agreement). 
• Dispute Redressal: A clear process for addressing grievances. [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12]  

In essence, RERA creates a structured, regulated environment, making property buying in India more secure and transparent. [4, 6]
