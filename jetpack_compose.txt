**Jetpack Compose** (often people casually say “Jet Compose”) is **Android’s modern UI toolkit**.

In simple words 👇
👉 It’s a **new way to build Android app screens using Kotlin code**, instead of XML layouts.

---

### Old way (XML + Java/Kotlin)

* Write UI in **XML**
* Write logic in **Activity/Fragment**
* Connect them with `findViewById`
* More boilerplate, harder to maintain 😵

---

### Jetpack Compose way

* UI is written **directly in Kotlin**
* UI automatically updates when data changes
* Less code, more readable ✨

Example:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello $name")
}
```

That’s it. No XML. No adapters. No `findViewById`.

### Key ideas of Jetpack Compose

🔹 **Declarative UI**
You *describe* what the UI should look like, not *how* to draw it.

🔹 **@Composable functions**
Special functions that create UI components.

🔹 **State-driven**
If data changes → UI updates automatically.

🔹 **100% Kotlin**
No XML files needed.

### Why Google introduced Jetpack Compose?

* Faster UI development 🚀
* Less boilerplate code
* Easier animations
* Better performance
* Inspired by **React / Flutter / SwiftUI**

### Compare quickly

| XML UI          | Jetpack Compose |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| XML + Kotlin    | Only Kotlin     |
| findViewById    | No need         |
| Hard animations | Easy            |
| More files      | Cleaner         |

### Is Jetpack Compose replacing XML?

✅ **Yes (gradually)**
Google recommends Compose for **new apps**.
