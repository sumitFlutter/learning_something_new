**Short answer:**
👉 **NO — a new JKS (keystore) alone does NOT hide your identity from Google Play.**

---

## How Google Play actually tracks identity

Google **does NOT rely on JKS** to identify developers.

A JKS only:

* Signs the **APK/AAB**
* Proves app update authenticity
* Links **app versions**, not **people**

Changing JKS = ❌ **does not reset identity**

---

## What Google *does* track (much stronger)

### 1️⃣ Developer identity

* Google account (email)
* Personal identity (Individual account)
* Phone number & recovery email
* 2FA history

### 2️⃣ Account & ecosystem links

* AdMob
* Firebase
* Analytics
* Google Cloud
* Play Console history

### 3️⃣ Device & access patterns

* Devices used to log in
* Google Play Services IDs
* Login behavior patterns

### 4️⃣ App similarity signals

* Code structure
* UI/UX layout
* Assets, strings, logic
* Package behavior

### 5️⃣ Network & payment signals

* IP history
* Payment profile
* Tax info

## What JKS *is* used for

| Purpose                       | Used for |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| App update verification       | ✅        |
| App ownership continuity      | ✅        |
| Developer identity tracking   | ❌        |
| Account association detection | ❌        |

## Critical warning (important)

After an **Individual account termination**:

> Any attempt to use **new JKS + new package name**
> is considered **policy circumvention**.

This can:

* Auto-terminate new accounts
* Kill any chance of appeal
* Harm other linked accounts

---

## Final honest advice

If your account is already **terminated**:

* New JKS ❌
* New email ❌
* New device ❌

👉 **Only appeal can help**, not technical changes.

If you want, tell me:

* Was the termination **before or after** app submission?
* Was it due to **association or direct violation**?

I’ll guide you safely.
