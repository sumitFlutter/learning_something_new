## 1️⃣ What is a **Notice Period** in an IT company?

A **notice period** is the time an employee or employer must give **in advance** before ending the employment.

In IT companies, it’s mentioned in:

* Appointment letter
* Employment contract

### Typical notice periods in IT:

* **15 days** – rare (startups)
* **30 days (1 month)** – common
* **60 days (2 months)**
* **90 days (3 months)** – very common in Indian IT companies

📌 Notice period applies when:

* Employee resigns
* Company terminates employment (except immediate termination cases)

## 2️⃣ Is an employee **eligible for salary during the notice period**?

✅ **YES**, salary **is applicable** during the notice period **if the employee is working**.

### Different scenarios explained:

#### 🔹 Case 1: Employee works during notice period

* ✔ Full salary is paid
* ✔ PF, tax, other deductions apply normally
* ✔ Considered active employment

#### 🔹 Case 2: Company asks employee not to work (Notice Pay / Garden Leave)

* ✔ Salary must still be paid
* ❌ Employee doesn’t need to work
* This is called **Garden Leave**

#### 🔹 Case 3: Employee wants to leave early (Buyout / Notice Pay)

* ❌ Employee must **pay salary for remaining notice days**
* Or salary is **deducted from final settlement**

Example:
90-day notice, worked only 30 days → pay or deduction for remaining 60 days

#### 🔹 Case 4: Immediate termination for misconduct

* ❌ Salary may **not** be paid for notice period
